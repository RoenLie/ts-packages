## Strategy
Each project/package will live inside a folder here in the packages directory.
Each package has its own branch, and all code changes to that package will happen inside that branch.
All changes done in the package branches will be merged to master, so that there is one universal truth.
But each branch does not know about the other projects existing in the repository.
